        The discontinuation of Youtube's Community Captions in 2020 left users
        who needed the increased accessibility unprovided for. Youtube cited the
        0.2% of users who used the Community Captioning service as too small a
        pool, but this is not too small at all to us.

        There are currently over 430 million of the world's population who are
        deaf or hard of hearing according to the World Health Organization. This
        value is also expected to increase to over 700 million by 2050, which
        can also be estimated as 1 in 10 people. Because of this, we sincerely
        and passionately believe in furthering accessibility online.
