###### ["React", "Tailwind", "Typescript"]

## Summary

This is simply a portfolio of my work, built using Next.JS, Tailwind, and Typescript. I chose these technologies due to my familiarity with them and my speed using them, and I chose to host using Vercel due to it being inexpensive and simple when integrating with NextJS. The website is ever-changing, evolving to best showcase my projects and skills, and to match my personal style and desire for fast and responsive layouts.

## Challenges

Being the first project I built with the intent to permanently deploy, I had to consider many aspects of web development that I previously hadn't. Principle amoung these was the need for a fast-loading layout, which initially seemed to conflict with my desire to use React for the sake of creating a responsive layout easily. However, after learning about React Server Components, I fully commited to using Next.JS to create a website that loads the primary content of my pages as fast as possible, while still allowing for the dynamic content I desired. All pages on this website now are loaded mostly server-side, even the project pages featuring dynamic content, allowing immediate rendering of said content on the client as well as removing the need to create a separate API for project data, which would add needless complexity to the website.

Other challenges included the need to create a responsive layout that would look good on both desktop and mobile, having to adapt the design to the limitations of web-browsers (turns out firefox doesn't like fixed gradient backgrounds), as well as having to learn the basics of deploying a website in a way that was compatible with my desired user experience. Overall, I love this project because it not only showcases my other projects, but because I believe it is a good representation of my skills as an adaptable developer. Furthermore, it gave me a taste of what working on real user-facing projects entails, re-enforcing my excitement for web development.
