## About

YouCaption is a platform for creating and sharing closed captions made for YouTube. Inspired by the discontinued YouTube Community Captions service, YouCaption was designed to increase the accessibility of YouTube videos by allowing fans to create and share captions for their favorite content creators. Creators can then publish these videos, allowing viewers with hearing disabilities or language barriers to enjoy their content.
