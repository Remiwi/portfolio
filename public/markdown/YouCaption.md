## Summary

YouCaption is a platform for creating and sharing closed captions made for YouTube, which can then be used by creators to increase the accessibility of their content to both the hearing-impaired and foreign-language speakers. This was my Senior Design Project, where I worked as

- A front-end developer, co-designing the layout, implementing the bulk of the pages, and optimizing search, table layouts, and data caching, resulting in a fast loading and highly responsive website.
- A project lead, managing the tech stack, setting goals and meetings, and advocating for the use of modern backend frameworks on behalf of my team, resulting in higher development speeds and increases in developer satisfaction.

## Context

YouCaption was created as a response to the discontinuation of YouTube Community Captions, a service that allowed fans to create and share captions for their favorite content creators. As someone who regularly uses subtitles and who believes in the importance and feasibility of community-driven accessibility, I excitedly proposed and led the project. Furthermore, some technical limitations were imposed at the instructor's discretion.

## Responsibilities

As my primary role of front-end development, I was tasked with co-designing and later implementing the website layout using React and Typescript. I was given the responsibility of all pages unrelated to the subtitle editor, as we concluded the editor was distinct enough from the rest of the project to require a separate developer. My work encompassed things like the landing page, to the display sorting of search results, to the optimization of data loading and caching using Tanstack Query. In this role, my contributions resulted in a hihgly responsive and intuitive website design, with a decrease in page loading times from several seconds to less than a second per page after caching.

Being later given the role of project lead, my responsibilities included everything from setting up the initial tech stack, to managing team goals and meetings, to advocating on behalf of my developers both within the team and with the instructors. My proudest contribution in this role was advocating for the allowance of modern backend frameworks, as newly implemented project restrictions were boxing my backend team into only using an outdated and poorly documented framework. This advocacy resulted in the instructors retracting the restriction for the class, allowing us to use FastAPI, a simple framework my team was excited to work with. The increased development speed let us amplify the project scope and quality, moving our timeline from a scale of weeks to days.

## Result

The final product is one of the projects I'm most proud of, both in it's technical/design aspects, but also in it's purpose. Our project was given full-marks by the three independent judges brought to evaluate our class. While the project is fully functional, it's currently not live due to the evolving priorities of the team and the lack of clear monetization methods for covering maintenance. In future, I would like to dedicate more time to this project, increasing it's accessibility and userbase, and potentially finding monetization methods that don't comprimise the values underlying the service.
