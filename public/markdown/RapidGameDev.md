# Rapid Game Development Projects

###### ["C#", "Unity"]

## Summary

This is a series of 6 games built over the course of 3 months for a rapid game development class. The games were built in Unity using C# and were required to include a variety of styles of genres. The format included a mix of solo- and team-based projects, with time constraints ranging from days to weeks. During this course, I was able to quickly learn and excel at a game engine and language I had no familiarity with, as well as how to work in many teams with very different dyanmics using version control and project management tools.

## Solo

My favorite projects of these projects were [Marble Maize Game](https://remivaughan.itch.io/cs3113-exercise-2) and [Blitz](https://remivaughan.itch.io/cs3113-exercise-3), both of which are still live on my itch.io page! Both of these games were created in 3-4 day sprints, during which I went beyond the requirements to make games that not only served as ways to learn the engine and language, but also as games that I could show off. They involved the creation of custom assets, including 3D models, sprite textures, and SFX, as well as the creation of programatic components such as custom menu systems and game mechanics that amplified game-feel and recieved high praise from play-testers.

My proudest moment as a game developer happened when various of my testers independently decided to share the games with their friends and actively compete for better scores without me knowing about it until months after the class ended. I also later recieved highly positive feedback from my classmates, many of whom requested to be assigned to my team for later projects.

## Teamwork

These projects were more challenging, as they involved coordinating with ever-changing team members. I was often asked to lead these teams and, despite my lack of team-based experience at the time, was able to coordinate the team by quickly establishing themes and shared goals using sketches and Notion, without stifling individual creativity with respect to implementation. I quickly learned how to use version control with Git and GitHub, as well as how to specifically apply these tools to Unity (which requires special consideration due to it's high use of binary files) by implementing systems for branching and merging that allowed for rapid iteration while avoiding merge conflicts. Finally, as I was often the developer with the most experience, I often volunteered to help teach my teammates how to write more readable and reusable code in practice, resulting in faster development times.

My favorite project among these was [Spirit Solver](). Despite being more of a game demo than a complete experience, it was the most the most polished and visually appealing 3D game I've worked on due to the passion all of the team members brought. For this project, I developed easily resuable menu, dialog, and inventory systems that allowed my teammates to focus on stage design and user experience.
